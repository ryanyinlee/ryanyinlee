### Welcome! 

My Github is a mess - but I'm grateful it exists. Being able to store projects, notes, and programs in a central location is incredibly convenient.

I'm currently learning Python on my own. My hope is I'm able to create some simple projects I've thought up. 

I'm also planning on enrolling into a Computer Science degree program - I'm pretty excited about this, not just so I can get a degree, but because the subjects are actually interesting to me.

I did QA testing in the past. If you need help with bugs I can contribute, even if just as a rubber duck.

Do you have an Open source project? Hit me up - especially if it's for a good cause, or it helps a lot of people. If you think I can contribute, let me know! I'll do the boring stuff.

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python
